<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coated Battery Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Process</li><li>Dry Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coated battery separators are divided into two types based on the manufacturing process: wet process and dry process. Wet process involves immersing a substrate in a coating solution, followed by drying and calendering. This method is cost-effective but may have environmental concerns. Dry process, on the other hand, involves coating the substrate with a dry mixture of powders followed by pressing and heating. This method is more environmentally friendly but may have higher production costs. Both methods have their own advantages and are used in various applications in the battery industry.</p></p>
