<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Density Racks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drive-in Rack</li><li>Drive-through Rack</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-density racks are designed to maximize storage capacity by utilizing vertical space efficiently. Drive-in racks allow forklifts to drive directly into the rack system and load items onto rails within the rack structure. Drive-through racks have entry and exit points on both sides, allowing forklifts to pass through the rack system. Drive-in racks are ideal for last in, first out (LIFO) inventory systems, while drive-through racks are better suited for first in, first out (FIFO) inventory systems. Both types of racks are commonly used in warehouses and distribution centers to maximize storage capacity.</p></p>
