<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport De-icing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spreader</li><li>Sprayer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Airport de-icing vehicles are essential for ensuring safe takeoffs and landings during winter weather conditions. There are two main types of de-icing vehicles - spreaders and sprayers. Spreaders distribute solid de-icing agents such as rock salt or sand on runways and taxiways to prevent ice accumulation. Sprayers, on the other hand, use liquid de-icing agents like glycol to spray directly onto aircraft surfaces to remove ice and snow. Both types of vehicles play a crucial role in maintaining airport operations during cold weather.</p></p>
