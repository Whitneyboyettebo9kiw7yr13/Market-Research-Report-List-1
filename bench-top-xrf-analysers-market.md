<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bench-top XRF Analysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wavelength Dispersive (WDXRF)</li><li>Energy Dispersive (EDXRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bench-top XRF Analysers are divided into two main types: Wavelength Dispersive (WDXRF) and Energy Dispersive (EDXRF). WDXRF measures the wavelength of X-ray emissions from a sample to determine its elemental composition, offering higher precision and accuracy but requiring more complex instrumentation. On the other hand, EDXRF measures the energy of X-ray emissions, providing a simpler and more cost-effective solution for elemental analysis. Both types of analysers are widely used in various industries for material testing and quality control purposes.</p></p>
