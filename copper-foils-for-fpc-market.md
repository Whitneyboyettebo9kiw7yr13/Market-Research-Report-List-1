<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Foils for FPC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrolytic Copper Foil</li><li>Rolled Copper Foil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper foils for FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) market are available in two main types: Electrolytic Copper Foil and Rolled Copper Foil. Electrolytic Copper Foil is produced by electroplating pure copper onto a rolling drum under controlled conditions, resulting in a smooth and highly conductive foil. On the other hand, Rolled Copper Foil is made by rolling copper ingots through a series of rollers to achieve the desired thickness and surface texture. Both types have their unique characteristics and applications in the electronics industry.</p></p>
