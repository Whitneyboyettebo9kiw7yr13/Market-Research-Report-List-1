<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting CRFP</li><li>Thermoplastic CRFP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) can be classified into two main types: Thermosetting and Thermoplastic CFRP. Thermosetting CFRP is formed by curing a resin at high temperatures which result in a strong, rigid material ideal for applications requiring high strength and durability. Thermoplastic CFRP on the other hand, can be reheated and reshaped, making it more flexible and enabling recycling. Both types have their own unique properties and applications, catering to a wide range of industries such as aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment.</p></p>
