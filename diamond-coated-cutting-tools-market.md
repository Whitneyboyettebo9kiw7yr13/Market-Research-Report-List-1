<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diamond Coated Cutting Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamond-coated</li><li>PVD Diamond-coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diamond coated cutting tools can be classified into two main types: chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond-coated tools and physical vapor deposition (PVD) diamond-coated tools. CVD diamond-coated tools are produced by chemical processes, resulting in a thick diamond coating that is highly durable and wear-resistant. PVD diamond-coated tools, on the other hand, are created through physical processes, resulting in a thin but extremely hard diamond coating. Both types of diamond coatings enhance the cutting performance and lifespan of tools in various machining applications.</p></p>
