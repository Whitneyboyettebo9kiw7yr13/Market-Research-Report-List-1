<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bonded Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plastic Injected Magnets</li><li>Plastic Pressed Magnets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bonded magnets come in two main types, plastic injected magnets and plastic pressed magnets. Plastic injected magnets are made by injecting magnetic powder into a mold and then heating it to form the final shape. Plastic pressed magnets, on the other hand, are made by compressing magnetic powder and plastic resin together in a mold. Both types offer unique advantages, such as complex shapes for plastic injected magnets and high conductivity for plastic pressed magnets. Each type caters to different applications and industries.</p></p>
