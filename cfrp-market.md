<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CFRP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) materials are commonly classified into two main categories based on their resin system: thermosetting and thermoplastic. Thermosetting CFRP materials are cured using heat, resulting in a rigid and durable final product. On the other hand, thermoplastic CFRP materials can be melted and reshaped multiple times, offering more flexibility in manufacturing. Both types of CFRP materials are widely used in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment for their lightweight, high-strength properties.</p></p>
