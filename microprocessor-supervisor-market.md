<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microprocessor Supervisor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Reset</li><li>Non-Manual Reset</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A microprocessor supervisor is a device that monitors and controls the operation of a microprocessor-based system. In the manual reset market, users must physically press a button to reset the supervisor, ensuring that the system is only reset when intentional. In the non-manual reset market, the supervisor automatically resets the system without any user intervention, which can be beneficial for applications where immediate recovery is critical. Both types offer different levels of control and convenience depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
