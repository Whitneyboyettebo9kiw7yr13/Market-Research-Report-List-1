<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Civil Aircraft Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The civil aircraft tire market is divided into two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have plies that run radially across the tire, providing better stability and fuel efficiency for modern aircraft. Bias tires, on the other hand, have plies that crisscross at an angle, offering greater load-carrying capacity and durability for older aircraft models. Both types of tires are essential components of aircraft landing gear systems, playing a crucial role in ensuring safe take-offs and landings.</p></p>
