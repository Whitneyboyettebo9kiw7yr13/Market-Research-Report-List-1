<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Starter Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ortho-phosphate</li><li>Poly-phosphate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Starter fertilizers can be categorized into two main types: ortho-phosphate and poly-phosphate. Ortho-phosphate fertilizers contain phosphorus in a form that is readily available for plant uptake, making them ideal for promoting early growth in crops. On the other hand, poly-phosphate fertilizers contain phosphorus in a form that needs to be converted into ortho-phosphate before plants can use it. Both types of starter fertilizers play a crucial role in providing essential nutrients to plants at the beginning of their growth cycle.</p></p>
