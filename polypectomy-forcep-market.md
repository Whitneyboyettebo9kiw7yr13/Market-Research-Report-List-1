<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypectomy Forcep Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot</li><li>Cold</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A hot polypectomy forcep uses high frequency electric current to heat up and cut through tissue, making it ideal for removing larger polyps quickly and effectively. In contrast, a cold polypectomy forcep relies on mechanical pressure to grasp and remove polyps without the need for heat, making it a safer option for delicate or smaller polyps. Both types of forceps are commonly used in endoscopic procedures to remove polyps from the gastrointestinal tract.</p></p>
