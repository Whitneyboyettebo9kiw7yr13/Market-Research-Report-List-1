<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nerve Locator/Stimulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Nerve Locator/Stimulator</li><li>Variable Nerve Locator/Stimulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fixed Nerve Locator/Stimulator devices have a predetermined set of stimulation parameters that cannot be adjusted by the user. They are programmed to deliver a specific level of stimulation to the nerve. On the other hand, Variable Nerve Locator/Stimulator devices allow the user to customize and adjust stimulation parameters such as frequency, intensity, and waveform according to the specific needs of the patient. This flexibility makes Variable Nerve Locator/Stimulator devices more versatile and suitable for a wider range of nerve stimulation procedures.</p></p>
