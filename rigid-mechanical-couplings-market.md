<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rigid Mechanical Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sleeve</li><li>Flanged</li><li>Clamped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rigid mechanical couplings are used to connect two shafts together in order to transmit power efficiently. Three common types of rigid mechanical couplings are sleeve, flanged, and clamped couplings. Sleeve couplings are simple, cost-effective couplings that connect two shafts with a sleeve. Flanged couplings have flanges that connect the shafts through bolts or screws, providing more stability. Clamped couplings use clamps to secure the shafts together, allowing for easy installation and removal. Each type of coupling has its own advantages and suitability for different applications.</p></p>
