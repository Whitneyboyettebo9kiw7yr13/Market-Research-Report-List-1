<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Viscose Filament Yarns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous</li><li>Semi-contunuous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Viscose filament yarns are produced in two different market types: continuous and semi-continuous. Continuous production involves a non-stop spinning process where the filaments are extruded continuously, resulting in long lengths of yarn. This type of market offers advantages such as high productivity and cost efficiency. On the other hand, semi-continuous production is intermittent, with yarn production occurring in batches. Although it may not be as efficient as continuous production, semi-continuous still allows for decent productivity and flexibility in meeting specific customer demands. Both market types cater to the demand for viscose filament yarns but differ in production methods.</p></p>
