<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Torque Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage Torque Converter</li><li>Multistage Torque Converter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automatic torque converter market consists of two main types: single-stage torque converters and multistage torque converters. Single-stage torque converters have a simpler design with a single set of stator and turbine blades, providing basic torque multiplication. On the other hand, multistage torque converters feature multiple sets of stator and turbine blades, offering higher torque multiplication and efficiency. Multistage torque converters are more complex and offer better performance compared to single-stage torque converters.</p></p>
