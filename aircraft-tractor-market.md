<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tractor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional tractors are the traditional type of aircraft tractors that use a towbar to connect and tow aircraft. They are commonly used for smaller aircraft and are cost-effective. Towbarless tractors, on the other hand, do not require a towbar as they lift the front wheels of the aircraft off the ground and tow it from the nose gear. This type is commonly used for larger aircraft and offers greater maneuverability and efficiency. Both types cater to different sizes and types of aircraft and have their unique advantages.</p></p>
