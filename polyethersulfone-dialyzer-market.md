<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyethersulfone Dialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Permeability</li><li>Low Permeability</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyethersulfone dialyzers in the high permeability market are designed to have larger pore sizes in the membrane, allowing for faster and more efficient diffusion of solutes across the membrane during dialysis treatments. This results in quicker and more thorough removal of waste products from the blood. On the other hand, polyethersulfone dialyzers in the low permeability market have smaller pore sizes in the membrane, leading to a slower diffusion rate and more selective removal of waste products. Both types cater to different patient needs and treatment requirements.</p></p>
