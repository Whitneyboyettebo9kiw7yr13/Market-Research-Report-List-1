<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-shrink Cement Grout Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-packed</li><li>Fluid Packaged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-shrink cement grout is divided into two main types: dry-packed and fluid packaged. Dry-packed grout is a pre-blended cement mixture that requires the addition of water on site to achieve a thick, putty-like consistency suitable for filling gaps or leveling surfaces. On the other hand, fluid packaged grout comes in a ready-to-use form that can be poured or pumped into place without the need for additional mixing. Both types are commonly used in construction for structural reinforcement, anchoring, and repairs.</p></p>
