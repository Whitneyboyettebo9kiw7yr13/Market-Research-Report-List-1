<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous Membrane</li><li>Homogeneous Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas film market consists of two main types: porous membrane and homogeneous membrane. Porous membranes are made up of a network of small pores that allow gas molecules to pass through while blocking larger molecules. This type of membrane is commonly used for applications requiring selective permeation. Homogeneous membranes, on the other hand, are made of a single material with uniform structure, allowing for more predictable gas separation. Both types of membranes play a crucial role in various industries such as food packaging, pharmaceuticals, and gas separation processes.</p></p>
